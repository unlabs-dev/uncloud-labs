## Material Management

This section covers the management of playgrounds and tutorials hosted on iximiuz Labs.

### Prerequisites

- [labctl](https://github.com/iximiuz/labctl) - CLI tool for managing iximiuz Labs content

### Managed Tutorials

Currently managed tutorials:

- [Create an Uncloud Cluster](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/uncloud-create-cluster-ebebf72b) - `manifests/tutorials/uncloud-create-cluster-ebebf72b/`
- [Deploy a Django App with Uncloud](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/uncloud-deploy-django-app-7a378bc3) - `manifests/tutorials/uncloud-deploy-django-app-7a378bc3/`

### Managed Playgrounds

Currently managed playgrounds:

- [Initialized Uncloud Cluster](https://labs.iximiuz.com/playgrounds/uncloud-cluster-64523f7c) - `manifests/playgrounds/uncloud-cluster-64523f7c.yaml`
- [Uninitialized Uncloud Cluster](https://labs.iximiuz.com/playgrounds/uncloud-uninitialized-cluster-cacb63ae) - `manifests/playgrounds/uncloud-uninitialized-cluster-cacb63ae.yaml`

### Persisting Manifests

You can save the manifests of all managed playgrounds and tutorials locally to the [`manifests/`](./manifests/) directory:

```bash
make pull-playgrounds
```

This is currently done purely for backup and version tracking reasons. The manifests are organized as:

- `manifests/playgrounds/` - YAML files for playground configurations
- `manifests/tutorials/` - Markdown files and assets for tutorial content
