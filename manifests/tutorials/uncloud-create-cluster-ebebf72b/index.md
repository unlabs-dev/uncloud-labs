💡 **What is Uncloud?** [Uncloud](https://uncloud.run/docs/) is a lightweight clustering and container orchestration tool that lets you deploy and manage web applications across cloud VMs and bare metal servers. Among other things, it creates a secure [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) mesh network between Docker hosts and provides automatic service discovery, load balancing, and HTTPS ingress — all without the complexity of Kubernetes.
::

## Tutorial Environment

It is highly encouraged to take advantage of the interactive features of the [iximiuz Labs platform](https://labs.iximiuz.com/about) and follow the tutorial by executing the commands in the interactive environment.

To get started, click the "Start Tutorial" button located under the table of contents on the left side of the screen (like, do it right now!). After a few seconds, you'll see a terminal on the right side of your screen.

In this tutorial, you have access to 3 machines:

- :tab{text='dev-machine' machine='dev-machine'} - the control-only environment that is not meant to run any actual containerized workloads. Think of it as your developer machine that you'll use to control the prospective cluster remotely.
- :tab{text='server-1' machine='server-1'}, :tab{text='server-2' machine='server-2'} - two "clean" Ubuntu machines that will become part of your new Uncloud cluster.

After you start the linked playground, you'll first see the shell on :tab{text='dev-machine' machine='dev-machine'} with Uncloud CLI (`uc` for short) already installed there. To install `uc` manually on your local (personal, non-tutorial) machine, check out the [installation guide](https://uncloud.run/docs/getting-started/install-cli) for instructions.

To test that the `uc` command works, run the following on :tab{text='dev-machine' machine='dev-machine'} to get the version of the Uncloud client:

```sh
uc --version
```

## Initializing a New Cluster

Let's initialize our first cluster by setting up `server-1` as the first machine.
Run the following commands on `dev-machine`:

```sh
uc machine init laborant@server-1 --public-ip none --no-dns
```

This command will install Docker, the Uncloud daemon (`uncloudd`), and all necessary dependencies on the remote machine. One critical component which is also installed automatically is the [Corrosion](https://github.com/superfly/corrosion) service, which will helpfully handle state synchronization and service discovery as soon as there's more than one machine in the cluster. Documentation on the `machine init` command can be found [here](https://uncloud.run/docs/cli-reference/uc_machine_init/).

::remark-box
**Why use `--public-ip none`?** The `--public-ip none` flag tells Uncloud not to configure this machine for ingress (incoming internet traffic) because in the multi-tenant iximiuz Labs environment we don't fully control the public IP addresses of the machine. In production, you'd typically use `--public-ip auto` (used by default) to automatically detect and configure ingress. Read more about publishing services in the [official documentation](https://uncloud.run/docs/concepts/ingress/publishing-services).
::

::remark-box
**Why use `--no-dns`?** The `--no-dns` flag skips reserving a free `*.uncld.dev` subdomain via Uncloud's managed DNS service. In the iximiuz Labs environment, this feature won't work due to the environment limitations, but you can use it for real scenarios. Check [`uc dns`](https://uncloud.run/docs/cli-reference/uc_dns) documentation for more information.
::

You can get the list of machines in the cluster along with their configuration and status via `uc machine ls` (or `uc m ls`, if you want to save a few keystrokes) command:

```
laborant@dev-machine:~$ uc machine ls
NAME           STATE   ADDRESS         PUBLIC IP        WIREGUARD ENDPOINTS                      MACHINE ID
machine-incv   Up      10.210.0.1/24   -                172.16.0.3:51820, 65.109.107.161:51820   6cec579e3d6fb7ffb51c5503d163f1be
```

As we can see, `server-1` became the first (and the only so far) machine in our new cluster. Let's break down what each column means:

- `NAME: machine-incv` - The unique name of the machine in the cluster; can vary from cluster to cluster. Can be changed (see the [corresponding section below](#updating-cluster-machines))
- `STATE: Up` - The current state of the machine. "Up" means the machine is running and the Uncloud daemon is active.
- `ADDRESS: 10.210.0.1/24` - The private IP address and subnet assigned to this machine in the WireGuard mesh network. Each machine gets its own `/24` subnet (by default, 10.210.0.0/24, 10.210.1.0/24, etc.) from which container IP addresses are allocated.
- `PUBLIC IP: -` - The public IP address of the machine for ingress (if configured). Since we used `--public-ip none`, this field is empty and shows `-`.
- `WIREGUARD ENDPOINTS` - The network endpoints where this machine's WireGuard interface can be reached by other machines in the cluster. This includes both private and public IP addresses with the WireGuard port.
- `MACHINE ID` - A unique identifier for the machine; it doesn't change throughout the lifecycle of the machine.

## Adding Another Machine to the Cluster

One initialized server isn't really a cluster, right? A proper cluster typically consists of multiple machines working together.

Let's add a second machine (`server-2`) to the cluster. The command is quite similar — the main difference is that we use [`add`](https://uncloud.run/docs/cli-reference/uc_machine_add) instead of [`init`](https://uncloud.run/docs/cli-reference/uc_machine_init):

```sh
uc machine add laborant@server-2
```

Similar to `server-1`, `server-2` now has all the important components (Docker, Uncloud daemon, etc.) up and running. The two machines are automatically connected via a secure WireGuard mesh network, allowing containers to communicate across machines.

Let's check the current state of the cluster:

```
laborant@dev-machine:~$ uc machine ls
NAME           STATE   ADDRESS         PUBLIC IP        WIREGUARD ENDPOINTS                      MACHINE ID
machine-incv   Up      10.210.0.1/24   -                172.16.0.3:51820, 65.109.107.161:51820   6cec579e3d6fb7ffb51c5503d163f1be
machine-m4wy   Up      10.210.1.1/24   -                172.16.0.4:51820, 65.109.107.161:51820   e84e115eff8570ecccc54947aa482f5c
```

Our cluster now consists of two nodes 🎉

## Updating Cluster Machines

By default, cluster machines are assigned internal names with randomized suffixes such as `machine-incv` or `machine-m4wy`.
It is possible to override those names by using `-n/--name` option during `add` or `init` steps.

You can also rename the cluster nodes via `uc machine rename` command, for example:

```
laborant@dev-machine:~$ uc machine rename machine-incv server-1
Machine "machine-incv" renamed to "server-1" (ID: 42866c05a37171dbbc1165216e8f886e)

laborant@dev-machine:~$ uc machine rename machine-m4wy server-2
Machine "machine-m4wy" renamed to "server-2" (ID: 4c453ff7a1c870456cfd69f78e74a34a)

laborant@dev-machine:~$ uc machine ls
NAME   STATE   ADDRESS         PUBLIC IP        WIREGUARD ENDPOINTS                      MACHINE ID
server-1     Up      10.210.0.1/24   -                172.16.0.3:51820, 65.109.107.161:51820   42866c05a37171dbbc1165216e8f886e
server-2     Up      10.210.1.1/24   -                172.16.0.4:51820, 65.109.107.161:51820   4c453ff7a1c870456cfd69f78e74a34a
```

If you want to change other properties of the machines such as public IP address, use [`uc machine update`](https://uncloud.run/docs/cli-reference/uc_machine_update) command.

## Context Management and Connections

It's possible to manage more than one cluster from a single control node. Uncloud CLI has context support, letting you switch between multiple clusters when necessary.

[`uc ctx`](https://uncloud.run/docs/cli-reference/uc_ctx) is the subcommand used for context management. Here's how you can list all available contexts on your control node:

```
laborant@dev-machine:~$ uc ctx ls
NAME      CURRENT   CONNECTIONS
default   ✓         2
```

As we see, only one context (`default`) is available, and it's set as the current context (it will be used by default when the commands you run don't include the `--context` option).

The output also shows that the context has two connections. This means the current configuration is aware of two nodes in the corresponding cluster and knows how to connect to either of them.

To view the full context configuration including connection information, you can check the generated configuration file, which is by default placed in `~/.config/uncloud/config.yaml` on your control node:

```yaml [~/.config/uncloud/config.yaml]
current_context: default
contexts:
  default:
    connections:
      - ssh: laborant@server-1
        ssh_key_file: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
      - ssh: laborant@server-2
        ssh_key_file: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

**Note:** A cluster context can have one or more connections, and each connection represents a way to reach a machine in the cluster via SSH. When you run commands, Uncloud automatically uses one of the available connections to communicate with the cluster. If one machine is unreachable, Uncloud CLI will try another connection until it finds the working one.

To switch contexts, use [`uc ctx use`](https://uncloud.run/docs/cli-reference/uc_ctx_use) command.

## Running a Simple Service

Now that we have a working cluster, let's deploy a simple web application to see the cluster in action. We'll use [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com), a popular sketching and diagramming tool.

First, let's check the currently running services:

```sh
uc ls
```

The output should look like this:

```
NAME    MODE     REPLICAS   IMAGE          ENDPOINTS
caddy   global   2          caddy:2.10.2
```

::remark-box
💡 [`uc ls`](https://uncloud.run/docs/cli-reference/uc_ls) is a shortcut for the [`uc service ls`](https://uncloud.run/docs/cli-reference/uc_service_ls) command. Check all [`uc service`](https://uncloud.run/docs/cli-reference/uc_service) commands for available service operations.
::

We can see that the Caddy web server was automatically deployed in the "global" mode, which means that an instance (replica) of this service runs on each node of the cluster, in our case - on both `server-1` and `server-2`. Caddy will help us later by automatically routing requests to the right machines and containers. Read more about managing Caddy deployment and configuration [in the documentation](https://uncloud.run/docs/concepts/ingress/managing-caddy).

We are ready to run the following command to deploy the Excalidraw service:

```sh
uc run --name excalidraw --publish excalidraw.internal:80/http excalidraw/excalidraw
```

After a few moments, you'll see output showing the service is running:

```
[+] Running service excalidraw (replicated mode) 2/2
 ✔ Container excalidraw-azpc on server-1  Started
   ✔ Image excalidraw/excalidraw on server-1  Pulled

excalidraw endpoints:
 • http://excalidraw.internal → :80
```

What `uc run` command did:

- Picked one of the two available cluster machines at random (`server-1` in our case).
- Pulled the `excalidraw/excalidraw` Docker image on that machine.
- Created a service named `excalidraw` with one container.
- Exposed the service on port 80 and `excalidraw.internal` hostname on ALL cluster machines, thanks to Caddy running in the "global" mode.

Let's check the status of the new service:

```
laborant@dev-machine:~$ uc ls
NAME         MODE         REPLICAS   IMAGE                   ENDPOINTS
caddy        global       1          caddy:2.10.2
excalidraw   replicated   1          excalidraw/excalidraw   http://excalidraw.internal → :80

laborant@dev-machine:~$ uc inspect excalidraw
Service ID: 0af10efcb5a0d9155268bbbcbfc1419f
Name:       excalidraw
Mode:       replicated
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                   CREATED         STATUS                   IP ADDRESS   MACHINE
38410444eaf3   excalidraw/excalidraw   2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes (healthy)   10.210.0.3   server-1
```

### Accessing the service

You can now access the running app via the :tab{text='Excalidraw' name='Excalidraw'} tab. If the app doesn't load, wait a few seconds and click the "Refresh" button.

You can also reach the service from the :tab{text='dev-machine' machine='dev-machine'} terminal. In that case, make sure to specify the correct "Host" header:

```sh
# You can target ANY server of the cluster (server-1 or server-2)
curl --header 'Host: excalidraw.internal' server-1
```

Congratulations! You've successfully created a multi-machine Uncloud cluster and deployed your first service. You can now explore more advanced features like scaling services across machines, using Docker Compose files, and setting up HTTPS ingress with custom domains.

## Next steps

- Scale your service to 2 replicas with [`uc scale`](https://uncloud.run/docs/cli-reference/uc_scale) command: `uc scale excalidraw 2`
- Deploy services using Compose-like configuration with `uc deploy` (check examples [in the documentation](https://uncloud.run/docs/guides/deployments/deploy-app))
- Learn about [publishing services](https://uncloud.run/docs/concepts/ingress/publishing-services) to the internet
- Experiment with an already initialized cluster [in the dedicated playground](https://labs.iximiuz.com/playgrounds/uncloud-cluster-64523f7c).
