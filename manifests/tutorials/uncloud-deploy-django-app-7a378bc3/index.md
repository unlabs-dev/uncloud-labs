Imagine you have developed a web application that works well in your local development environment. It is time now to deploy it somewhere for the rest of the world to use and enjoy. How do we do this without fighting our way through a dozen different tools and cloud services?

In this hands-on tutorial, you'll learn how to deploy a Django web application quickly and easily from source code to a remote Linux server using **Uncloud**.

::remark-box
💡 **What is Uncloud?** [Uncloud](https://uncloud.run/docs/) is a lightweight clustering and container orchestration tool that lets you deploy and manage web applications across cloud VMs and bare metal servers. It creates a secure [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) mesh network between Docker hosts and provides automatic service discovery, load balancing, and HTTPS ingress - all without the complexity of Kubernetes.
::

**Prerequisites**

Before starting this tutorial, you should have:

- A basic understanding of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and containers. There are great tutorials and courses available on **iximiuz Labs** (the very same platform you're using now), for example check out the [Docker skill path](https://labs.iximiuz.com/skill-paths/docker-101-run-and-manage-containers) if you want to brush up on fundamentals.
- Some familiarity with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework.
- A basic understanding of Uncloud and how an Uncloud cluster functions. If you haven't completed the initial Uncloud tutorial ([How to Create an Uncloud Cluster](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/uncloud-create-cluster-ebebf72b)), we recommend starting there.

**What You'll Learn**

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:

1. Dockerize a Django application using a Dockerfile
2. Create a Compose file for deployment configuration
3. Build and deploy your application using Uncloud
4. Access your deployed application through the web browser
5. Check the application logs
6. Execute commands inside the running container for maintenance and troubleshooting

Let's get started!

---

## Tutorial Environment

It is highly encouraged to take advantage of the interactive features of the [iximiuz Labs platform](https://labs.iximiuz.com/about) and follow the tutorial by executing the commands in the interactive environment.

To get started, click the "Start Tutorial" button located under the table of contents on the left side of the screen (go ahead, do it now!). After a few seconds, you'll see a terminal on the right side of your screen.

In this tutorial, you have access to the following machines:

- :tab{text='dev-machine' machine='dev-machine'} - the control-only environment where you'll prepare the application and run Uncloud CLI commands. Think of it as your developer machine that you'll use to control the cluster remotely. The Uncloud cluster is already initialized and can be managed by the `uc` command.
- :tab{text='server-1' machine='server-1'}, :tab{text='server-2' machine='server-2'} - two Ubuntu machines that are already part of an initialized Uncloud cluster where your application will be deployed.

## Preparing Your Django Application

The Django application source code is already available on :tab{text='dev-machine' machine='dev-machine'} in the `~/app` directory. It is a sample issue tracking application built with Django that we'll be using as an example.

### Understanding the Application Structure

Let's take a look at the application structure:

```sh
cd ~/app
tree -L 2
```

You should see a typical Django project structure:

```
.
├── Dockerfile          # Container image definition
├── README.md           # Project documentation
├── compose.yaml        # Uncloud/Compose deployment configuration
├── issues              # Application directory with models, views, and templates
│   ├── __init__.py     # Package marker
│   ├── admin.py        # Django admin panel registration
│   ├── apps.py         # Application configuration
│   ├── forms.py        # Form definitions
│   ├── migrations      # Database migration history
│   ├── models.py       # Database models
│   ├── static          # Static files (CSS, JS, images)
│   ├── templates       # HTML templates
│   ├── tests.py        # Automated tests
│   ├── urls.py         # Application URL routing
│   └── views.py        # View functions and classes
├── issuetracker        # Main project directory with core settings and routing configuration
│   ├── __init__.py     # Package marker
│   ├── asgi.py         # ASGI entry point for async servers
│   ├── settings.py     # Project settings
│   ├── urls.py         # Root URL routing configuration
│   └── wsgi.py         # WSGI entry point for production servers
├── manage.py           # Django management script
└── requirements.txt    # File listing Python dependencies
```

Check the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/) if you want to dig deeper on the format and purpose of each component.

### Data Management

A traditionally interesting question for every application that maintains some kind of state would be: how and where are we storing the data? In the initial implementation we'll be using a [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) database as the main data storage. An SQLite database is in essence a single file and doesn't require a running process; our Django application will be working with that file directly since Django has built-in support for SQLite database files. We'll also make sure that the database file is stored on a persistent volume so that data survives container restarts.

### Dockerizing the Application

To deploy this application with Uncloud, we need to containerize it first. There is already a `Dockerfile` at `~/app/Dockerfile` that defines how to build a container image for our application, let's have a look at it:

```dockerfile [~/app/Dockerfile]
# Use Python 3.14 as the base image
FROM python:3.14-slim

# Set up the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install helper system utilities
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    sqlite3 \
    procps \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Python dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Create a non-root user
RUN useradd --create-home --shell /bin/bash appuser

# Create data directory for database and set ownership
RUN mkdir -p /data && chown appuser:appuser /data

# Set environment variable for database path
ENV DATABASE_PATH=/data/db.sqlite3

# Copy application code
COPY --chown=appuser:appuser . .

# Collect static files
RUN python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

# Switch to non-root user
USER appuser

# Expose application port
EXPOSE 8000

# Declare volume for database persistence
VOLUME ["/data"]

# Run database migrations and start Gunicorn application server
CMD ["sh", "-c", "python manage.py migrate && gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --workers 2 issuetracker.wsgi:application"]
```

::remark-box
📝 **Dependency management**: We're using plain `pip` and `requirements.txt` file to manage Python dependencies in this tutorial, mainly to keep the focus on Uncloud-related concepts. For modern alternatives, we recommend looking at [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as a universal Python package and environment manager.
::

### Testing the Docker Build

Before deploying with Uncloud, let's verify that our Docker image builds successfully:

```sh
cd ~/app
docker build -t issue-tracker .
```

You should see Docker building the image layer by layer.

You can verify the image was created:

```
laborant@dev-machine:app$ docker images

IMAGE                  ID             DISK USAGE   CONTENT SIZE   EXTRA
issue-tracker:latest   96b10b1a9bfc        263MB         57.5MB
```

## Deploying to Uncloud Cluster

Now that we've confirmed the image builds successfully, we have everything we need to deploy the application using Uncloud.

### Creating a Compose File

Uncloud uses the [Compose Specification](https://compose-spec.io/) to define deployment configurations. Let's have a look at the `compose.yaml` file in the application directory:

```yaml [~/app/compose.yaml]
services:
  issue-tracker:
    # Build the image from the current directory
    build: .

    # Expose the application on a public URL
    x-ports:
      - issue-tracker.internal:8000/http

    # Mount a named volume for the database data
    volumes:
      - db_data:/data

# Define a named volume for the database data
volumes:
  db_data:
```

Let's break down what this configuration does:

- **`build: .`** - Tells Uncloud to build a container image from the Dockerfile in the current directory
- **`x-ports`** - Uncloud-specific extension that configures ingress routing. This makes your application reachable via the specified domain (`issue-tracker.internal`); `:8000` indicates that inside the container the Django application listens on port 8000.
- **`volumes`** - Defines a [named volume](https://uncloud.run/docs/cli-reference/uc_volume) `db_data` that is mounted to the `/data` directory inside the container. This allows the SQLite database file to persist across container restarts and deployments.

::remark-box
**About the domain configuration**: In a real-world scenario, you would replace `issue-tracker.internal` with your actual domain name. For this tutorial environment in iximiuz Labs, we'll use `issue-tracker.internal` as it's also configured in the playground settings, which will make the app accessible via the :tab{text='Application' name='Application'} tab.
::

### Building and Deploying with `uc deploy`

Now for the exciting part - deploying your application! Navigate to your application directory and run:

```sh
cd ~/app
uc deploy
```

You'll see output similar to:

```
Building service 'issue-tracker'...

[+] Building 45.2s (10/10) FINISHED

[+] Building 1/1

```

Congratulations, your Django application is now running on the Uncloud cluster 🎉

::remark-box
💡 [`uc deploy`](https://uncloud.run/docs/cli-reference/uc_deploy) is a powerful command that handles the entire deployment workflow. Check out the [CLI reference](https://uncloud.run/docs/cli-reference/uc_deploy) for all available options and flags.
::

### Understanding the Deployment Process

What happened under the hood when you ran `uc deploy`? That single command did the following:

1. **Built and tagged the image**: Your local Docker daemon built the image from the Dockerfile and tagged it with a unique timestamp-based tag. Note that Uncloud will take care of building the image for you, so you don't need to worry about manually building or tagging it before deployment every time.
2. **Pushed the image to the cluster**: Uncloud transferred the image directly to your cluster machines using the [unregistry](https://github.com/psviderski/unregistry) helper, without needing an external registry like Docker Hub. Only the layers that don't already exist on the target machines are transferred, making subsequent deployments much faster.
3. **Prepared a new deployment**: Uncloud printed the list of changes and asked for your confirmation.
4. **Started a new container**: Uncloud created and started the application container.
5. **Configured ingress**: Uncloud automatically set up the routing so that your application is accessible via the specified domain.

### Verifying the Deployment

Check that your service is running:

```sh
uc ls
```

You should see output similar to:

```
NAME            MODE         REPLICAS   IMAGE                                 ENDPOINTS
caddy           global       2          caddy:2.10.2
issue-tracker   replicated   1          app/issue-tracker:2026-02-22-215149   http://issue-tracker.internal → :8000
```

::remark-box
💡 [`uc ls`](https://uncloud.run/docs/cli-reference/uc_ls) is a shortcut for the [`uc service ls`](https://uncloud.run/docs/cli-reference/uc_service_ls) command. Check all [`uc service`](https://uncloud.run/docs/cli-reference/uc_service) commands for available service operations.
::

For more detailed information about the service:

```sh
uc inspect issue-tracker
```

The output will show you the container details:

```
Service ID: 3f11c85f774a9d07e16e90d209c1ddf0
Name:       issue-tracker
Mode:       replicated

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                 CREATED         STATUS         IP ADDRESS   MACHINE
6b32aa328c13   app/issue-tracker:2026-02-22-215149   5 minutes ago   Up 5 minutes   10.210.0.3   server-1
```

## Accessing Your Application

### In the iximiuz Labs Environment

In this tutorial environment, you can access your deployed application using the built-in browser. Click on the :tab{text='Application' name='Application'} tab at the top of your screen.

You should see the Django issue tracker homepage with a couple pre-created issues. Try creating a new issue to verify everything is working correctly.

:alt: 'Running Django Application'
:max-width: 800px
---

::
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

You can also reach the service from the :tab{text='dev-machine' machine='dev-machine'} terminal using tools like `curl`. In that case, make sure to specify the correct "Host" header:

```sh
# You can target ANY server of the cluster (server-1 or server-2)
curl --header 'Host: issue-tracker.internal' server-1
```

### In a Real-World Deployment

In a production environment with Uncloud:

1. **Domain Configuration**: You would configure your domain's DNS to point to your Uncloud cluster
2. **Automatic TLS certificates and HTTPS**: Uncloud automatically provisions TLS certificates using Let's Encrypt and makes your application immediately accessible via HTTPS at the domain you specified in the `x-ports` configuration
3. **Ingress Management**: Uncloud handles all the ingress routing, TLS termination, and load balancing for you

::remark-box
📚 **Learn More**: For detailed information about publishing services to the internet with custom domains and automatic TLS, check out the [Publishing Services](https://uncloud.run/docs/concepts/ingress/publishing-services) documentation.

## Making Updates

One of the powerful features of Uncloud is how easy it is to deploy updates. Let's say you made changes to your application code. Simply run the deploy command again:

```sh
uc deploy
```

Uncloud will:

1. Detect the changes
2. Rebuild the container image if necessary
3. Push only the changed layers to the cluster
4. Perform a zero-downtime rolling update

Your new version will be deployed without any service interruption.

### Deploying Configuration Changes Only

If you only changed the `compose.yaml` file (for example, updated environment variables) without modifying the application code, you can deploy just the configuration:

```sh
uc deploy --no-build
```

This skips the build step and only updates the service configuration.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
::remark-box
---
kind: warning
---

⚠️ **Image Tag Considerations**: When using dynamic image tags based on Git state (which is the default when your project is part of a git repository), deploying with `--no-build` may fail if the tag has changed. See [Deploy configuration changes only](https://uncloud.run/docs/guides/deployments/deploy-app/#deploy-configuration-changes-only) in the official docs for best practices.

## Checking Application Logs

Great, now your application is running on the remote machine. At some point you'll want to peek at what the application is writing to its output - whether that's verifying a successful startup, investigating an error, or just checking request activity. To check the output of the deployed application, you can use the [uc logs](https://uncloud.run/docs/cli-reference/uc_logs/) command:

```sh
uc logs issue-tracker
```

You will get the output produced by the app:

```
Feb 22 21:51:59.434 server-1 issue-tracker[6b32a] Operations to perform:

```

`uc logs` is a powerful command that can accept a handful of arguments to control the filtering and time limits, for example:

```sh
# Show the last 3 hours of logs for service "caddy" from machine "server-1" and continually stream the new logs
uc logs --machine server-1 --since 3h --follow caddy
```

## Creating an Admin User with `uc exec`

Our application is working, but we cannot log in to the Django admin panel yet because we haven't created an admin user. To create one, we need to run the [`createsuperuser`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/ref/django-admin/#createsuperuser) management command inside the running container. This is where [uc exec](https://uncloud.run/docs/cli-reference/uc_exec) comes to the rescue: it allows you to execute any command inside the running container on the remote machine, just like `docker exec` or `kubectl exec`, but for your Uncloud cluster.

Let's create a superuser with username "admin":

```text
laborant@dev-machine:~$ uc exec issue-tracker ./manage.py createsuperuser
Username (leave blank to use 'appuser'): admin
Email address: admin@example.com
Password:
Password (again):
Superuser created successfully.
```

You can now log in to the Django admin panel: just click on the "Admin" button in the top right corner of the application page and use the credentials you just created.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed a Django application to Uncloud, made it accessible to the outside world, checked the logs, and even executed management commands inside the running container. You've got a solid foundation to build upon.

Here are some things you can explore next:

1. **Add a Database Service**: Extend your `compose.yaml` to include a PostgreSQL database service instead of SQLite
2. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive configuration like database passwords or API keys
3. **Multiple Services**: Deploy additional services like Redis for caching or Celery for background tasks
4. **Scale Your Service**: Try scaling your service to multiple replicas with [`uc scale`](https://uncloud.run/docs/cli-reference/uc_scale): `uc scale issue-tracker 2`
